# 🚩 This is my Repo for Computer Organization Assembly Labs

This repository contains my lab assignments and practice exercises for the **CSE321: Computer Organization** course at **Zagazig University**.
The labs are mainly written in **MIPS Assembly** and aim to deepen understanding of low-level programming and computer architecture concepts.
